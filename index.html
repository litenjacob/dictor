		<p>Not until liberalization in the late 18th century, however, were believers of other faiths, including <a href="/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism" title="Roman Catholicism" class="mw-redirect">Roman Catholicism</a>, allowed to openly live and work in Sweden, and it remained illegal until 1860 for Lutheran Swedes to convert to another religion. The 19th century saw the arrival of various <a href="/wiki/Low_church" title="Low church">evangelical</a> <a href="/wiki/Free_church" title="Free church">free churches</a>, and, towards the end of the century <a href="/wiki/Secularism" title="Secularism">secularism</a>, leading many to distance themselves from Church rituals. Leaving the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Sweden" title="Church of Sweden">Church of Sweden</a> became legal with the so-called dissenter law of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another denomination. The right to stand outside any religious denomination was established in the Law on <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_Religion" title="Freedom of Religion" class="mw-redirect">Freedom of Religion</a> in 1951.</p>

		<p>At the end of 2008, 72,9% of Swedes belonged to the Church of Sweden (Lutheran), this number has been decreasing by about 1% on a yearly basis for the last two decades. Church of Sweden services are sparsely attended (hovering in the single digit percentages of the population).<sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-108"><span>[</span>109<span>]</span></a></sup> Between 46–85% of the population can be classified as atheist or agnostic. The reason for the large number of inactive members is partly that until 1996, children became members automatically at birth if at least one of the parents was a member. Since 1996, only children that are christened become members. Some 275,000 Swedes are today members of various free churches (where congregation attendance is much higher), and, in addition, <a href="/wiki/Immigration" title="Immigration">immigration</a> has meant that there are now some 92,000 <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholics" title="Roman Catholics" class="mw-redirect">Roman Catholics</a> and 100,000 <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="Eastern Orthodox Church" class="mw-redirect">Eastern Orthodox Christians</a> living in Sweden.<sup id="cite_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-109"><span>[</span>110<span>]</span></a></sup> Because of <a href="/wiki/Immigration" title="Immigration">immigration</a>, Sweden also has a significant <a href="/wiki/Muslim" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> population. Almost half a million are Muslims by tradition, but approximately 5% (25,000) of these actively practise Islam (in the sense of attending Friday prayer and praying five times a day).<sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-110"><span>[</span>111<span>]</span></a></sup> (See <a href="/wiki/Islam_in_Sweden" title="Islam in Sweden">Islam in Sweden</a>.)</p>
